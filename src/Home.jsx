                <p>This document has a ton of different options at many different price points that hopefully can serve as a launching pad for shopping for your outfit. This is by no means exhaustive and do not feel at all like you have to choose something from this resource. </p>
                <p>Also, all of the dresses/suits/etc. provided are under the guise that you will acessorize and bring your own pizzaz to your outfit. I've created a ppt with more examples as well that can be used as a tool to help get a better idea of what exactly we're looking for. Black suits are totally ok as long as you have something to spice it up.</p>
                <p>My Pinterest board for guest dress code is linked in this document as well as on our website and can also be used as a vibe check as you're finding what you think will suit you best.</p>
                <p>Love you lots! Happy shopping!</p>
